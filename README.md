# Introduction to index funds

Most people are familiar with the practice of buying shares of a company’s [stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp) in order to establish fractional ownership in the company. They are also aware that stock prices can increase or decrease, resulting in potentially large gains or losses. What is the best way for the average person to profitably invest in the stock market and achieve long-term compounding growth of their money? The evidence indicates that diversified [index funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) are an optimal way of doing so. They capture the growth of the stock market driven largely by a small fraction of companies, whose identities are difficult to predict and will shift over time. (For explanation, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdMDGIABek&ab_channel=BenFelix) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thNrIsU88y8&ab_channel=BenFelix)).

What is an index fund? The term _fund_ indicates that your money is pooled with that of many others to purchase an array of [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) that a small amount of money [wouldn’t be able to buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICBgPBswovQ&t=263s&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel). The securities in the index funds discussed below are almost entirely stocks, numbering in the hundreds or thousands. The term _index_ implies that management of the fund’s holdings is not influenced by active decisions regarding which stocks to trade and when to trade them. Instead, the performance of the fund is intended to reflect its index as closely as possible.

One common index is the S&P 500, a well-known group of 500 of the largest companies in the US. Index fund managers purchase proportionate shares in all of an index’s securities or attempt to purchase a representative sample of shares. Someone invested in the S&P 500 index would experience the aggregate gains and losses associated with that group of companies, weighted by company size. So a 1% increase in the largest company’s share price would boost the index’s performance far more than a 1% increase in the smallest company’s share price. This is referred to as [market cap weighting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp). A company’s market capitalization, commonly shortened to market cap, is its share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. (See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A4lp_oZ5zg&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel) for more on indices.)

There are two broad types of funds whose shares can be purchased to track an index: mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In both cases, shares are [not limited](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-endfund.asp) as they are when issued by a company, so purchasing shares can be thought of as inserting money into a pool. A fund’s share price is often referred to as the _net asset value_ ([NAV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp)). A fund can increase the wealth of its shareholders in two ways: capital gains — that is, an increase in the NAV due to appreciation of the fund’s holdings — and income, including dividends, which can be reinvested in more shares or not. When you view the [total return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturn.asp) of a fund over a given period on its webpage, that refers to capital gains plus income (assuming immediate reinvestment).

In an exchange-traded fund (ETF), shares are [traded](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/resources/education/how-etfs-are-created-and-redeemed) (from an investor’s perspective) like stocks are traded on a stock exchange. As with stocks, ETFs trade at varying prices throughout the day and can be bought and sold during market hours (9:30am-4pm ET, Mon-Fri). Also like stocks, they have a [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp), which means that the price at which a share can be sold is slightly lower than the price at which it can be bought at any given instant.

In a mutual fund, the NAV is updated once per day after market hours have concluded at 4pm based on the fund’s net gain or loss. All orders to buy or sell since 4pm the prior day are executed based on the new NAV. You can introduce any amount of money into the fund. If you decided to invest $5,000 and the NAV were $15, you would purchase 333.333 shares. If you decided to sell when the value of the fund's holdings rose by 20%, the NAV would be $18 and selling all shares would yield $6,000.

## ETFs or mutual funds?

When investing in a taxable account, ETFs are the obvious choice because they make taxable events more straightforward and enable more control over taxes. The specifics are summarized [here](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency). ETFs also make it easier to use funds from multiple institutions in a single account. If you want to buy mutual funds in a Fidelity brokerage account, you'll pay a fee upon purchase if the mutual funds are managed by someone else, like Vanguard or Schwab. But ETFs are not gatekept, and you can buy the ETF counterparts of Vanguard and Schwab funds with no such fee. ETFs can be traded frequently, which is a small benefit to long-term investors.<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> In contrast, by imposing a delay on trading shares, mutual funds encourage a long-term perspective. They also enable [automatic investment plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automaticinvestmentplan.asp), whereas ETFs do not. Especially for small investors, a drawback of ETFs is the requirement to purchase discrete shares rather than simply investing any amount. 

How consequential is the issue of investing exact amounts in ETFs? ETF share prices usually range from $30 to $250. Those at the higher end are less common and tend to [split](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-stock-split-why-do-stocks-split/) 2:1 or 4:1 — meaning the price is divided by two or four — so that they don’t become too expensive. A small amount of money will be left uninvested regardless of share prices, unless you purchase a fractional share. Fidelity is the only major broker which enables fractional trading of ETFs. See the [section on practical information](https://github.com/investindex/Practical) for how to use fractional shares.

Given that the issue of precise allocation with ETFs is small, we can decide on the following rule: ETFs are preferable for taxable investing while the two types are about equally suitable for tax-advantaged investing. However, if an automatic investment plan is appealing to you, be aware that this is offered only through mutual funds.

Indexed mutual funds and ETFs have the advantage of low fees. To see the annual fees charged by a fund, look for its [expense ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp). All funds suggested here have expense ratios less than .40%, and some are less than .10%. Every fund has a descriptive name as well as a ticker symbol, like SPTM, which serves as a short but unambiguous label for the fund. ETF symbols have two to four letters, and mutual fund symbols have five letters ending in an _X_.

Before exploring potential portfolios of stock ETFs and mutual funds, we should consider how to navigate risk. And because most people cannot keep all their money in stocks, we’ll cover how to grow a portion of your assets with bonds, which carry a spectrum of lower risk (and lower return) than the stock market can provide.

Footnote:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> ETFs are also more transparent, updating their holdings daily for anyone to view. It is possible to short sell ETF shares or buy them on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp). Limit orders and stop orders are permitted, in contrast to mutual funds. ETFs can be leveraged or inverse (that is, your investment gains value when the index falls in value); these two characteristics are possible in mutual funds but are far less common. [↩](#fn1)
