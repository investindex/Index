# Introduction to index funds

An investment is a commitment of resources with the potential for a positive return — a gain. In this guide we'll discuss various reasons for investing: increasing personal consumption, keeping ahead of price inflation, and funding long-term financial goals, most crucially retirement. Let's begin with a central arena for creating wealth through investing: the stock market.

Most people are familiar with the practice of buying shares of a company’s [stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp) in order to establish fractional ownership in the company. Ownership is also known as _equity_. Companies sell their stock because they need to raise money; investors are willing to provide money in exchange for the potential benefits of ownership. Stock prices are related to the expected future profits of a company, and owners' rights to those expected profits are why fractional ownership of a company is potentially valuable. But there are many companies you could invest in, with the potential for large gains or losses. So what is the best way for the average person to profitably invest in the stock market and achieve long-term compounding growth of their money? The evidence indicates that diversified [index funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) are an optimal way of doing so.

What is an index fund? The term _fund_ indicates that your money is pooled with that of many others to purchase an array of stocks that a small amount of money [wouldn’t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICBgPBswovQ&t=263s&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel) be able to buy on its own. The term _index_ implies that management of the fund’s holdings is not influenced by active decisions regarding which stocks to trade and when to trade them. Instead, the performance of the fund is intended to reflect its index as closely as possible. An [index](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/index.asp) is like a list of directions for an index fund, showing which stocks it needs to own and in what proportions. Most indices are updated quarterly, and index funds revise their holdings accordingly. So an index fund is an institutionally managed structure which uses money from many participants to build a portfolio of stocks that will match the performance of its benchmark index, without regard for what that performance is.

The index with the most dollars tethered to it is the [S&P 500](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR7e1Y-HJxQ&ab_channel=BenFelix), a group of 500 of the largest companies in the US. Index fund managers purchase proportionate shares of all stocks in the index or attempt to purchase shares in a representative sample of stocks. Someone invested in an S&P 500 index fund experiences the aggregate gains and losses associated with that group of companies, weighted by company size. So a 1% increase in the largest company’s share price boosts the fund’s performance far more than a 1% increase in the smallest company’s share price. This is referred to as [market cap weighting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp). A company’s market capitalization, commonly shortened to market cap, is the total value of all of its shares. [Apple](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL) is the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap of $2.9 trillion. [Costco](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/COST) is another company in the S&P 500, with a market cap of about $230 billion. Because Apple is more valuable, a larger portion of your investment in the S&P 500 is [allocated](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239726/ishares-core-sp-500-etf) to Apple than Costco (6.8% vs. 0.6%). But you effectively own the same fraction of each company — roughly one billionth for a small investor. So another way of conceiving of cap-weighted index funds is that you effectively own the same fraction of each company in the index. Market cap weighting is [not](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=RSP) the only way funds weight different stocks, but it is the most common because it allocates invested dollars in proportion to the available opportunity set.

To clarify: I'm not recommending an S&P 500 index fund, but it is a simple index — 500 companies weighted by market cap — so it works well as an illustration. See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A4lp_oZ5zg&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel) for more on indices.

In contrast to index funds, some funds are actively managed. Managers of these funds have a great deal of freedom in their investment decisions. Letting a professional manage your stock picks may sound appealing, but index funds nearly always [outperform](https://rickferri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WhitePaper.pdf) actively managed funds in the long run.<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup> Broad index funds capture the growth of the stock market driven largely by a small fraction of companies, whose identities are difficult to predict and will shift over time. Click the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdMDGIABek&ab_channel=BenFelix) for explanation.

The optimality of index funds relies on the idea that markets are [efficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbPVTqd468c&ab_channel=BenFelix), which simply means that prices reflect available information and quickly adapt to new information. No market is perfectly efficient, but the argument underlying index funds is that the market is efficient enough to make it very difficult to continually beat the market through active management, either on your own or by selecting actively managed funds. It follows that the best investments for nearly everyone are tax-efficient funds with low fees that capture standard market returns. A majority of those who attempt to beat the market by straying from broad index funds end up underperforming.

The _share price_ is the price someone pays to buy one share, which could be a share of a company's stock or a share of a fund. The share price of a fund in particular is often referred to as the _net asset value_ ([NAV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp)). When discussing funds I will use the terms _share price_ and _NAV_ interchangeably.<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup> There is nothing intrinsically meaningful about a share price. A company is not more valuable if its share price is, say, $200 instead of $100. Costco's share price is currently higher than Apple's, but Apple's market cap is far larger. Shares of a fund or a company's stock can undergo a [split](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-stock-split-why-do-stocks-split/). A 2:1 split, for instance, means that the share price is halved and all shareholders own twice as many shares. This is generally conducted to prevent the share price from becoming unreasonably high. Apple stock has undergone [five splits](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/history?p=AAPL), which were 2:1, 2:1, 2:1, 7:1, and 4:1. This means that without any splits, Apple's stock price would be 2×2×2×7×4 = 224 times its current price, which is about $175.

&nbsp;

## ETFs and mutual funds

There are two broad types of funds whose shares can be purchased to track an index: mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In both cases, shares are [not limited](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-endfund.asp) as they are when issued by a company, so purchasing shares can be thought of as inserting money into a pool.

In an exchange-traded fund (ETF), shares are [traded](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/resources/education/how-etfs-are-created-and-redeemed) (from an investor’s perspective) like stocks are traded on a stock exchange. As with stocks, ETFs trade at varying prices throughout the day and can be bought and sold during market hours (9:30am-4pm ET, Mon-Fri). Also like stocks, they have a [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp). A spread is one type of transaction cost. It means that the price at which a share can be bought is slightly higher than the price at which it can be sold at any given instant. For example, the price at which shares can be bought might be $116.13 while the price at which they can be sold is $116.11. The share price in this case would be defined as the midpoint between these two prices, which is $116.12. Shares are purchased discretely — you can buy 6, 14, or 23 but not 6½. So if the share price is currently $60, an investor can introduce money into the fund in multiples of $60.

In contrast to stocks and ETFs, whose prices may update every second, mutual funds publish only one price per day and can be transacted only once per day. The NAV is updated after market hours have concluded at 4pm based on the fund’s net gain or loss that day. All orders to buy or sell since 4pm the prior day are executed based on the new NAV. There is no bid-ask spread: investors buy or sell at the same price on a given day. You can introduce any amount of money into the fund. If you decided to invest $5,000 and the NAV were $15, you would purchase 333.333 shares. If you decided to sell when the value of the fund's holdings rose by 20%, the NAV would be $18 and selling all shares would yield $6,000.

When investing in a taxable account, ETFs are preferable because they make taxable events more straightforward and enable more control over taxes. The specifics are summarized [here](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency). ETFs also make it easier to use funds from multiple institutions in a single account. If you want to buy mutual funds in a Fidelity brokerage account, there are no fees if the mutual funds are managed by Fidelity. But you'll often pay a hefty transaction fee if the mutual funds are managed by someone else, like Vanguard or Schwab. The situation is similar when using a Vanguard or Schwab brokerage account. Even worse, some brokers simply do not offer the option to purchase certain mutual funds managed by others. But ETFs are publicly traded securities, and all major brokers allow you to buy ETFs with no such fees.

ETFs can be traded frequently, which is convenient but carries little importance for long-term investors.<sup id="fn4">[4](#f4)</sup> In contrast, by imposing a delay on trading shares, mutual funds encourage a long-term perspective. For small investors, a drawback of ETFs is the requirement to purchase discrete shares rather than simply investing any amount.

How consequential is the issue of investing exact amounts in ETFs? ETF share prices usually range from $30 to $250. Those at the higher end are less common and tend to split 2:1 or 4:1 — meaning the price is divided by two or four — so that they don’t become too expensive. A small amount of money will be left uninvested regardless of share prices. If the share price is $120, for example, you may have $50 left in the account that you can't invest unless you purchase a [fractional share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3oZOg9yRuY&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel). Fidelity is the only major broker which enables fractional trading of ETFs. See the [section on practical information](https://github.com/investindex/Practical#fractional-shares) for how to use fractional shares. Overall the issue of precise allocation with ETFs is small.

So the main distinctions are that mutual funds allow easy investment of a precise amount, while ETFs are more tax-efficient, allow frequent trading, and are not gatekept by institutional managers. We can decide on the following rule: ETFs are preferable for taxable investing while the two types are about equally suitable for [tax-advantaged investing](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts).

## More on how funds work

A fund can increase the wealth of its shareholders in two ways: _capital gains_ and _distributions_. Capital gains correspond to increases in the share price due to an increase in the value of the fund’s holdings. If you buy shares of a fund at $85 and the share price increases to $90, that is a capital gain, because you can sell the shares for a profit if you choose. If your shares rise in value but you haven't yet sold, you have an _unrealized capital gain_; when you sell the shares, you _realize_ the gain. The most common distribution is a cash [dividend](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp). What is a dividend? Some companies distribute earnings by simply paying cash to stockholders, and the funds pass this cash on to you. For example, at the end of a given quarter, a fund may announce a dividend of $0.65 per share. If you own 100 shares, you would receive a $65 dividend on the payment date.<sup id="fn3">[3](#f3)</sup>

While a concrete cash payment may be appealing, a payment to shareholders implies an equivalent reduction in the value of each share. By definition, each share is worth $0.65 less after the dividend, and there is [no reason to prefer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ&ab_channel=BenFelix) a $0.65 per share dividend payment to a $0.65 increase in the share price. The advisable response to dividend payments is to pretend they never happened and immediately reinvest them, unless you happen to need the cash. If you need to generate income at any time, you can simply sell shares. The drawback of dividends is that they compel you to withdraw money from the investment, thereby creating a taxable event, even if you don't have a present need for income.

The other type of distribution is a [capital gains distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgainsdistribution.asp). These are chiefly carried out by mutual funds, and represent the taxable realized gains and losses that the fund is legally required to pass on to its shareholders. The primary reason that stock ETFs are more tax-efficient is that they almost never have capital gains distributions. Again, the default response to capital gains distributions should be to immediately reinvest them.

The combination of a fund's capital gains plus distributions (assuming immediate reinvestment of distributions) is an important performance characteristic of the fund called its [total return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturn.asp), which can be easily viewed on its webpage. It is generally illustrated by showing how an initial investment of $10,000 would have changed in value over time.

Indexed mutual funds and ETFs have the advantage of low fees. To see the annual fees charged by a fund, look for its [expense ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp). All funds suggested here were selected partly for low expense ratios. A .10% expense ratio means you'll be charged ten cents annually for every $100 invested in the fund. Expense ratios are important, but small differences — like .05% vs. .11% — should not be the sole determinant of choosing one fund over another. (Some people become overly preoccupied with tiny differences in fees.) These fees are automatically withdrawn from the fund, so a fund's returns are always presented after fees; you don't need to mentally subtract any fees when viewing performance. The term [_basis point_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp) is a convenient way to express a hundredth of a percentage point. An expense ratio of .25% can be expressed as 25 basis points. If Fund A returned 7.6% in a given year and Fund B returned 7.0%, we can say that Fund A beat Fund B by 60 basis points.

Although this section focused on stock funds, funds can hold [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) other than stocks (like [bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#understanding-bonds-and-their-risks)). Every fund has a descriptive name as well as a ticker symbol, like AVUV, which serves as a short but unambiguous label for the fund. ETF symbols have two to four letters, and mutual fund symbols have five letters ending in an _X_ like SWAGX.

&nbsp;

## Investing is easy now

Investing in the stock market used to mean accepting a heavy burden of fees. Many mutual funds had a large fee upon purchasing shares or upon selling shares. A fee of 8% was typical: you would pay 8% of your investment for the privilege of investing the other 92%. Expense ratios used to be much higher, above 1%. Commissions for purchasing individual stocks were high: it was common decades ago to pay your broker 1% of the value of the shares you were purchasing (or an expensive flat fee). And you had to buy shares in multiples of 100, or face even higher commissions. The need to buy at least 100 shares of each company meant that building a diversified portfolio of stocks on your own required already having a lot of money.

Today, the stock market is available to anyone with internet access and a bank account. You can buy shares of [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT) for about $100 each and invest in the market cap-weighted global stock market — over 9,000 stocks in more than 40 countries. You won't pay fees for purchasing or selling shares, and your expense ratio is .08%. This is a product even the wealthiest people couldn't imagine in 1980: owning the global market for _eight basis points_. Investors today are extremely fortunate compared to those in the past.

&nbsp;

## Summary

The stock market is a means of buying and selling fractional ownership in publicly traded companies. _Equity_ in a company is another term that expresses owning stock. For nearly everyone, the most effective method of benefiting from the stock market is to purchase shares of a fund, which owns a diversified portfolio of stocks. The portfolio should be directed by an index, rather than by the choices of an active manager. ETFs and mutual funds are the two broad structures of these funds. A fund has the potential to increase the wealth of its shareholders through increases in the value of its holdings — the many individual stocks — and through distributions, particularly cash dividends. They charge fees expressed as expense ratios, and low fees are one important criterion for selecting funds.

&nbsp;

We will eventually explore potential portfolios of stock ETFs and mutual funds, but first we should consider how to navigate risk. And because most people cannot keep all their money in stocks, we’ll cover how to grow a portion of your assets with bonds, which carry a spectrum of lower risk (and lower return) than the stock market can provide.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> The SPIVA reports are a great illustration of how poorly actively managed funds perform in the long run. In the [most recent report](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/spiva-us-year-end-2020.pdf#page=9), we find that over the last 20 years, 88% of small cap funds, 88% of mid cap funds, and 94% of large cap funds have underperformed their benchmark. Someone might reasonably ask: if we select funds that performed well in the recent past, are we likely to invest in funds that continue to produce high returns? The SPIVA [persistence scorecard](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/spiva/persistence-scorecard-year-end-2020.pdf#page=7) shows how poorly that approach works. Among the funds with performance in the top 25% of their category from 2011-2015, what portion remained in the top 25% from 2016-2020? 12% of the small cap funds, 6% of the mid cap funds, and 19% of the large cap funds. And as the first document shows, even those in the top 25% are likely to fall behind their benchmark over longer periods. The evidence indicates that picking an actively managed fund that outperforms its benchmark in the long run is largely a matter of luck, and you would have to be very lucky to do so. You are overwhelmingly likely to underperform the index by picking active funds, regardless of their recent performance.

But why? Why are there so few actively managed funds that consistently outperform a fair benchmark? I think there are several reasons. (1) A great deal of temporary outperformance is due to luck, and luck rarely persists for periods as long as 20 years. (2) Fees are high in actively managed funds, putting any active manager at a disadvantage compared to low-fee index funds. (3) Active managers are mainly competing against and trading with other institutional investors. What matters is not whether the active managers are highly skilled and equipped with deep resources — many are — but whether they can continually outcompete other active managers. (4) Managers who show any signs of skill are quickly buried in money. If you're managing a $20 million fund, you can use a small number of your best ideas. But success brings excited new investors. Once you're managing billions of dollars, you have to spread the money across an increasing number of companies, and your best 500 investment ideas simply can't be as good as your best 50. (5) The few truly exceptional managers make a ton of money and often decide to retire young, leaving someone else to manage the fund. [↩](#fn1)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> The NAV and the share price are not actually synonymous, although they're often used interchangeably. This is a technical point that need not be understood to be a successful investor. Net asset value (NAV) is a fund's net assets (assets minus liabilities) divided by the number of shares. A party called the [authorized participant](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedparticipant.asp) does its best to keep an ETF's share price very close to the NAV, by [creating or redeeming](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/resources/education/how-etfs-are-created-and-redeemed) ETF shares to meet current demand for shares. This must be done so that shareholders experience capital gains or losses that correspond closely to the gains or losses of the fund's holdings.

The ETF issuer State Street has a useful plot of the degree to which a fund's NAV deviates from its share price over time. The greatest deviations occur due to large, tumultuous price movements during and after market crashes. See, for example, [SPDW](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-developed-world-ex-us-etf-spdw) and look for the section called "Premium Discount to NAV Graph and Summary". On some days shares trade at a premium — the share price is higher than the NAV — while on others they trade at a discount. The deviation is expressed in [basis points](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp), abbreviated bps. Some funds (like [SPTM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-sp-1500-composite-stock-market-etf-sptm)) deviate much less than others (like [SPEM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-emerging-markets-etf-spem)). Schwab's fund webpages also have this feature under the "Performance" tab (e.g., [FNDX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndx)), and Vanguard's webpages display it under the "Price and Performance" tab (e.g., [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/etf/profile/VT)). [↩](#fn2)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> The payment date is easy to understand: it's the date on which the cash lands in your account. This may occur early in the day, or as late as the evening after the market has closed. The other important date is the _ex-dividend date_, which may also be called the _ex-date_. Those who own shares at market close on the day before the ex-dividend date will receive the upcoming dividend payment, regardless of whether they sell some or all of their shares before the payment. Those who buy shares on or after the ex-dividend date will not receive it. (This implies that, all else equal, the value of each share falls by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date.) You may want to understand another date called the [record date](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recorddate.asp), which is always the business day after the ex-dividend date. However, this is a formality and in practice, all you need to know is that those who buy shares before the ex-date receive the dividend on the payment date.

How do you know what these dates will be? You can check any fund's webpage (like [this one](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/schf) or [this one](https://www.invesco.com/us/financial-products/etfs/product-detail?audienceType=Investor&ticker=EQAL)) and under "distributions", it will show the fund's past distributions and possibly an upcoming set of dates. Distributions include dividends (which may be labeled "income" instead) as well as [capital gains distributions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalgainsdistribution.asp). [↩](#fn3)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> ETFs are also more transparent, updating their holdings daily for anyone to view. It is possible to short sell ETF shares or buy them on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp). Limit orders and stop orders are permitted, in contrast to mutual funds. ETFs can be leveraged or inverse (that is, your investment gains value when the index falls in value); these two characteristics are possible in mutual funds but are far less common. [↩](#fn4)
