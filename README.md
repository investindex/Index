# Introduction to index funds

Most people are familiar with the practice of buying shares of a company’s [stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp) in order to establish fractional ownership in the company. They are also aware that stock prices can increase or decrease, resulting in potentially large gains or losses. What is the best way for the average person to profitably invest in the stock market and achieve long-term compounding growth of their money? The evidence indicates that diversified [index funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfund.asp) are an optimal way of doing so.

What is an index fund? The term _fund_ indicates that your money is pooled with that of many others to purchase an array of stocks that a small amount of money [wouldn’t be able to buy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICBgPBswovQ&t=263s&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel). Funds can hold [securities](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security.asp) other than stocks (like [bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#bonds-and-the-spectrum-of-risk)), but this section will focus on stock funds. The term _index_ implies that management of the fund’s holdings is not influenced by active decisions regarding which stocks to trade and when to trade them. Instead, the performance of the fund is intended to reflect its index as closely as possible. So an index fund is an institutionally managed structure which uses money from many participants to build a portfolio of stocks that will match the performance of its benchmark index, without regard for what that performance is.

Broad index funds capture the growth of the stock market driven largely by a small fraction of companies, whose identities are difficult to predict and will shift over time. This is why they nearly always [outperform](https://rickferri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WhitePaper.pdf) actively managed funds in the long run. (For explanation, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdMDGIABek&ab_channel=BenFelix) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thNrIsU88y8&ab_channel=BenFelix)). The optimality of index funds relies on the idea that markets are [efficient](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbPVTqd468c&ab_channel=BenFelix), which simply means that prices reflect available information and quickly adapt to new information. No market is perfectly efficient, but the argument underlying index funds is that the market is efficient enough that the best investments for nearly everyone are funds that capture standard market returns, because it is very difficult to continually beat the market.

The index with the most dollars tethered to it is the S&P 500, a group of 500 of the largest companies in the US. Index fund managers purchase proportionate shares in all of an index’s securities or attempt to purchase a representative sample of shares. Someone invested in the S&P 500 index would experience the aggregate gains and losses associated with that group of companies, weighted by company size. So a 1% increase in the largest company’s share price would boost the index’s performance far more than a 1% increase in the smallest company’s share price. This is referred to as [market cap weighting](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalizationweightedindex.asp). A company’s market capitalization, commonly shortened to market cap, is its share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares. (See [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A4lp_oZ5zg&ab_channel=ThePlainBagel) for more on indices.)

A fund’s share price is often referred to as the _net asset value_ ([NAV](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nav.asp)). I will use the terms _share price_ and _NAV_ interchangeably.<sup id="fn1">[1](#f1)</sup>

A fund can increase the wealth of its shareholders in two ways: capital gains — that is, an increase in the NAV due to an increase in the value of the fund’s holdings — and income. [Dividends](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp) are the most common form of income: some companies distribute earnings by simply paying cash to stockholders, and the funds pass this cash on to you (often on a quarterly basis). While a concrete cash payment may be appealing, a payment to shareholders implies an equivalent reduction in the value of each share. There is [no reason to prefer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5j9v9dfinQ&ab_channel=BenFelix) a $1 per share dividend payment to a $1 increase in the share price. The advisable response to dividend payments is to pretend they never happened and immediately reinvest them, unless you happen to need the cash. If you need to generate income at any time, you can simply sell shares. The drawback of dividends is that they effectively compel you to sell shares even if you don't have a present need for income. The combination of a fund's capital gains plus income (assuming immediate reinvestment of income) is an important performance characteristic of the fund called its [total return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturn.asp), which can be easily viewed on its webpage.

There are two broad types of funds whose shares can be purchased to track an index: mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In both cases, shares are [not limited](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/open-endfund.asp) as they are when issued by a company, so purchasing shares can be thought of as inserting money into a pool.

In an exchange-traded fund (ETF), shares are [traded](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/resources/education/how-etfs-are-created-and-redeemed) (from an investor’s perspective) like stocks are traded on a stock exchange. As with stocks, ETFs trade at varying prices throughout the day and can be bought and sold during market hours (9:30am-4pm ET, Mon-Fri). Also like stocks, they have a [bid-ask spread](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp), which means that the price at which a share can be sold is slightly lower than the price at which it can be bought at any given instant. Shares are purchased discretely, so if the share price is currently $60, an investor can introduce money into the fund in multiples of $60.

In contrast to stocks and ETFs, whose prices may update every second, mutual funds publish only one price per day. The NAV is updated after market hours have concluded at 4pm based on the fund’s net gain or loss that day. All orders to buy or sell since 4pm the prior day are executed based on the new NAV. There is no bid-ask spread: investors buy or sell at the same price on a given day. You can introduce any amount of money into the fund. If you decided to invest $5,000 and the NAV were $15, you would purchase 333.333 shares. If you decided to sell when the value of the fund's holdings rose by 20%, the NAV would be $18 and selling all shares would yield $6,000.

## ETFs or mutual funds?

When investing in a taxable account, ETFs are the obvious choice because they make taxable events more straightforward and enable more control over taxes. The specifics are summarized [here](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency). ETFs also make it easier to use funds from multiple institutions in a single account. If you want to buy mutual funds in a Fidelity brokerage account, there are no fees if the mutual funds are managed by Fidelity. But you'll often pay a fee upon purchase if the mutual funds are managed by someone else, like Vanguard or Schwab. The situation is similar when using a Vanguard or Schwab brokerage account. Even worse, some brokers simply do not offer the option to purchase certain mutual funds managed by others. But ETFs are not gatekept, and all major brokers allow you to buy ETFs with no such fees.

ETFs can be traded frequently, which is convenient but carries little importance for long-term investors.<sup id="fn2">[2](#f2)</sup> In contrast, by imposing a delay on trading shares, mutual funds encourage a long-term perspective. They also enable [automatic investment plans](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/automaticinvestmentplan.asp), whereas ETFs do not. Especially for small investors, a drawback of ETFs is the requirement to purchase discrete shares rather than simply investing any amount.

How consequential is the issue of investing exact amounts in ETFs? ETF share prices usually range from $30 to $250. Those at the higher end are less common and tend to [split](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/what-stock-split-why-do-stocks-split/) 2:1 or 4:1 — meaning the price is divided by two or four — so that they don’t become too expensive. A small amount of money will be left uninvested regardless of share prices, unless you purchase a fractional share. Fidelity is the only major broker which enables fractional trading of ETFs. See the [section on practical information](https://github.com/investindex/Practical#fractional-shares) for how to use fractional shares. Overall the issue of precise allocation with ETFs is small.

So the main distinctions are that mutual funds allow automatic investment plans and investment of a precise amount, while ETFs are more tax-efficient, allow frequent trading, and are not gatekept by institutional managers. We can decide on the following rule: ETFs are preferable for taxable investing while the two types are about equally suitable for [tax-advantaged investing](https://github.com/investindex/Guidelines#tax-advantaged-accounts).

Indexed mutual funds and ETFs have the advantage of low fees. To see the annual fees charged by a fund, look for its [expense ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expenseratio.asp). All funds suggested here were selected partly for low expense ratios. A .10% expense ratio means you'll be charged ten cents annually for every $100 invested in the fund. Expense ratios are important, but small differences — like .05% vs. .08% — should not be the sole determinant of choosing one fund over another. These fees are automatically withdrawn from the fund, so a fund's returns are always presented after fees; you don't need to mentally subtract any fees when viewing performance. The term [_basis point_](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp) is a convenient way to express a hundredth of a percentage point. An expense ratio of .25% can be expressed as 25 basis points. If Fund A returned 7.6% in a given year and Fund B returned 7.0%, we can say that Fund A beat Fund B by 60 basis points.

Every fund has a descriptive name as well as a ticker symbol, like SPTM, which serves as a short but unambiguous label for the fund. ETF symbols have two to four letters, and mutual fund symbols have five letters ending in an _X_ like FISVX.

Before exploring potential portfolios of stock ETFs and mutual funds, we should consider how to navigate risk. And because most people cannot keep all their money in stocks, we’ll cover how to grow a portion of your assets with bonds, which carry a spectrum of lower risk (and lower return) than the stock market can provide.

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> The NAV and the share price are not actually synonymous, although they're often used interchangeably. Net asset value (NAV) is a fund's net assets (assets minus liabilities) divided by the number of shares. A party called the [authorized participant](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/authorizedparticipant.asp) does its best to keep an ETF's share price very close to the NAV, by creating or redeeming ETF shares to meet current demand for shares. This must be done so that shareholders experience capital gains or losses that correspond closely to the gains or losses of the fund's holdings.

The ETF issuer State Street has a useful plot of the degree to which a fund's NAV deviates from its share price over time. The greatest deviations occur due to large, tumultuous price movements during and after market crashes. See, for example, [SPDW](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-developed-world-ex-us-etf-spdw) and look for the section called "Premium Discount to NAV Graph and Summary". On some days shares trade at a premium — the share price is higher than the NAV — while on others they trade at a discount. The deviation is expressed in [basis points](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basispoint.asp), abbreviated bps. Some funds (like [SPTM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-sp-1500-composite-stock-market-etf-sptm)) deviate much less than others (like [SPEM](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-portfolio-emerging-markets-etf-spem)). Schwab's fund webpages also have this feature under the "Performance" tab (e.g., [FNDX](https://www.schwabassetmanagement.com/products/fndx)). [↩](#fn1)

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> ETFs are also more transparent, updating their holdings daily for anyone to view. It is possible to short sell ETF shares or buy them on [margin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margin.asp). Limit orders and stop orders are permitted, in contrast to mutual funds. ETFs can be leveraged or inverse (that is, your investment gains value when the index falls in value); these two characteristics are possible in mutual funds but are far less common. [↩](#fn2)
